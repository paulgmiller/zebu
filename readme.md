## TODO 

## Basics
allow to re-register
likes 
individual post url
retweets?

### Bandwidth
Had to limit using resource manger which is sub-optimal. Trying to figure out why

### UI 
* Limit posts with option to see more
* better image galleries.
* https://galleriajs.github.io/themes/
* https://www.liwen.id.au/heg/
* better buttons for moblie. Hell maybe a mobile app

### Embed ipfs?
Or use infura / web3.storage for hosted version
https://github.com/ipfs/go-ds-s3


## scale ipfs
loadbalancer with different ports
optionally return imags through cloudflare ipfs gateway 
look at cluster ipfs and hole punching 


### protect against spam. 
Look at addreses account balance integral  of period 

## run importer
let rss feeds get added through api
nitter has rss feeds. Let people follow people on twitter that way?

## Activity pub integration?

## e2e test. !!!
* Create a new account
* register a dns name

## parallize fetching.
